# This Programm a simulation of a household inspired by "The Sims" to practice OOP. 

# Classes and Attributes:
# Define a base class Person with attributes like name, age, and gender.
# Create classes Furniture and Consumable with relevant attributes (e.g., type, color for Furniture; name, expiration_date for Consumable).

# Inheritance:
# Extend the Person class to create Child, Parent, and Grandparent classes, adding or modifying attributes and methods as needed.

# Encapsulation, Properties (Getter & Setter):
# Use encapsulation in the Person class. For instance, make the age attribute private and provide a getter and setter.
# Demonstrate a case where a setter is more appropriate (e.g., updating age) versus direct access.

# Constructor, Instantiation:
# Ensure each class has an appropriate constructor (__init__ method) to initialize its attributes.

# Object Lifetime & Garbage Collector:
# Experiment with creating and deleting objects, and observe how Python's garbage collector works.

# Association and Composition:
# Use composition to create a House class containing Person, Furniture, and Consumable objects.
# Show association by, for example, linking Child objects with Parent objects.

# Copy vs. Deepcopy, Mutable Default Arguments:
# Demonstrate the difference between shallow and deep copies with objects.
# Explore the mutable default argument problem and its solution.

# Reflection and Serialization:
# Use reflection to inspect objects at runtime (e.g., list all attributes of a Person).
# Implement serialization to save and load the state of your household simulation.

# Lazy Loading:
# Implement lazy loading for a resource-intensive attribute in one of your classes.

# Inheritance and Multiple Inheritance:
# Utilize multiple inheritance carefully in your class design, if applicable.

# Duck Typing and (Runtime) Polymorphism:
# Show examples of duck typing and polymorphism in your simulation.

# Dunders (__str__, __repr__, __bool__, etc.):
# Implement these methods in your classes to define their string representation, boolean conversion, etc.

# Slots:
# Use __slots__ in a class to explicitly declare allowed attributes and understand its memory benefits.

# Best Practices, Parameter Classes, and Multiple Returns:
# Create classes to encapsulate parameters where needed.
# Demonstrate functions/methods that return multiple values.
