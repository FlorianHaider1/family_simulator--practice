# This Programm is household-simulation inspired by "The Sims" to practice OOP. 
# Classes and Attributes, including constructor
#   Base class Person with attributes like name, age, and gender.
#   Base class Furniture: type, color   
#   Base class Consumable: name, expiration_date 
# Composition:  
#   Composition: Base class house: containing Person, Furniture, and Consumable objects.
#   Composition: create rooms in the house and purposes for the rooms
#   Composition: link e.g. parents and children
# x Inheritance: Extend Person class: Child, Parent, and Grandparent. Be aware of multiple inheritances.
# x Encapsulation, Properties (Getter & Setter):  make the age attribute private and provide a getter and setter.
# x Copy vs. Deepcopy: Use shallow and deep copies with objects.
# x Mutable Default Arguments: Explore the mutable default argument problem and its solution.
# x Reflection: Use reflection to inspect objects at runtime (e.g., list all attributes of a Person). 
# Serialization: Implement serialization to save and load the state of your household simulation.
# To Add:
# Lazy Loading: # Implement lazy loading for a resource-intensive attribute in one of your classes.
# Duck Typing and (Runtime) Polymorphism: Show examples of duck typing and polymorphism in your simulation.
# Dunders (__str__, __repr__, __bool__, etc.): Implementin your classes to define their string representation, boolean conversion, etc.
# Slots: Use __slots__ in a class to explicitly declare allowed attributes and understand its memory benefits.
# Object Lifetime & Garbage Collector: Experiment with creating and deleting objects, and observe how Python's garbage collector works.
# Make a usecase where set/get is better than setter/getter
